# Mobile-Robot-Simulation
This project will focus on the simulation of a differential mobile robot using MATLAB, assuming the working conditions are ideal.
#
To run this simulation, first off, download all the files and extract the toolbox file. (Note: make sure the toolbox files are in the working directory when open in MATLAB)
Open MATLAB and run the "startMobileRoboticsSimulationToolbox.m" file, then run the "Set up path" session in .m file.
#
Run either the "demoMap.m" or the "complexMap.m" file to load the map to MATLAB working space.
Then run the PathPlanning_PRM or PathPlanning_PRM_Mods or the PRM_RobotDis to begin the simulation.
